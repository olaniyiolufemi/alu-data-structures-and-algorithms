# Removing Duplicate Integers using Sorted Linked List

## Description
This Python script removes duplicate integers from an input file and prints them to the output file in ascending order. It utilizes a sorted linked list data structure to efficiently handle the sorting and removal of duplicates.

## How it Works
- Reads data from an input file line by line.
- Validates each line to ensure it contains a valid integer.
- Inserts the integer into a sorted linked list while avoiding duplicates.
- Writes the sorted unique integers to the output file.

## Usage
1. Ensure you have Python 3.x installed on your system.
2. Clone or download this repository to your local machine.
3. Navigate to the directory containing the script.
4. Execute the script by running the following command:
   ```bash
   python unique_int.py

## Input File Format
- The input file should contain one integer per line.
- Non-integer lines will be skipped.
